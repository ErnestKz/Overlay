motherboard supports way of giving a program the power to operate it
for the rest of the duration of its lifetime

capacitors is hardware component that convert a chip signal to a motherboard signal

processors are just motherboards with smaller circuits


unified extensible firmware interface
is the assembly code for the motherboard program




what is the part that hands control of hardware from:
- motherboard program
to: UEFI/ BIOS
- "linux kernel"


motherboard is prety flexible with how the cpu gets to control the rest of the hardware

since the cpu becomes the sole central logic unit, the motherboards circuitry from then
on is to be able to provide power
